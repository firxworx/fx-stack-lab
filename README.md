Experiments, PoC's, and educational tangents in the land of TypeScript and beyond.

## Development

You probably don't want to use anything in this repo.

If you insist, `pnpm` is recommended and dependencies can be installed with `pnpm install`.

Refer to `package.json` for scripts. This workspace is managed using the [Nx build system](https://nx.dev/).
